    *or for css and layout*
    "/user/layouts/homepage"
    
Thanks for choosing bread, by doing so you're helping me just
by using it and any bugs you may find as a result of using new
software can be reported directly to me on my [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/BreadFramework/bread/issues).

This release includes the following

- Revamped Bread Page System
- Search feature that any module can hook into.
- Control panel that allows you to make simple configuration changes and user edits.
- Layouts are now recursive and so you can have a master layout that applys to all your pages.
- User Control System that allows you to define the boundarys of your users on you're site and even grouping them.
- Still using under 2MB per request and about 1MB for most.
- Still flat file based, no more database problems or hard to understand settings systems.
- Still using a structure similar to the tried and tested methods of UNIX-like kernels :)
- Support for most of bootstrap features through the bread theme system.
- XSLT, a dynamic theming system that allows you to create normal HTML and replace parts with variables saving you development time.
- Speedups in our Module System
- Dynamic loading of modules, you just have to let bread know where the module is and dynamic loading will load the module when needed.
- **Lots** of misc bugfixes.
- Finally almost all browsers will render stuff correctly thanks to bootstraps excellent grid system.
