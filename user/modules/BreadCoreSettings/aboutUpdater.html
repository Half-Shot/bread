<h4>Bread Updater Information</h4>
<p>
A few words about the state of bread before you dash in to update it.
Bread is released in a 2 month-ish fashion but we can never promise anything.
As a result, there are 3 channels for you to use.
    <ul>
        <li>The most stable is the LTS channel ,which provides long term support by the Bread Team. However it will always be behind on features.</li>
        <li>The next up is the release channel. While generally stable, it is not thoroughly tested and will require updating every 1-2 months.</li>
        <li>The final channel is the git release channel. This is the most up to date, but contains the most bugs and really is only for the brave</li>
    </ul>
